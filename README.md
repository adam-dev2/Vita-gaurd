## VITAGUARD
# Micronutrient Tracker Website

A comprehensive, user-friendly website built with the MERN stack to help users track their daily vitamin and mineral intake and make informed dietary choices. Key components of the project include:

- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login with JWT token-based authentication to ensure data privacy.
  
- **Custom Nutrient Tracking:** Users can log food items or recipes, using API calls to retrieve detailed nutritional information.

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Nutrient intake is visualized through interactive pie charts and graphs to provide clear insights into daily consumption levels.

- **Notifications and Reminders:** Automated notifications alert users about any deficiencies or overconsumption of certain nutrients, helping them adjust their diet as needed.

- **API Integration:** Integration with third-party nutrition APIs ensures the accuracy of nutritional data, supporting precise tracking for a broad range of foods.

- **Data Storage and Management:** MongoDB is used to store user data securely, supporting efficient data handling and retrieval for each userâ€™s dietary history.

- **Future Scope:** Planned features include an OCR-based medical report scanner to interpret health data directly from user-uploaded documents and provide tailored nutrition recommendations based on clinical values.

This project provides an essential tool for users aiming to improve their health through mindful nutrient tracking and informed dietary habits.
